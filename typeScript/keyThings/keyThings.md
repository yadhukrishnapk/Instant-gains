## Types and interfaces are both used in TypeScript to define the shape of objects, but they have some key differences:
Declaration Merging:


Interfaces support declaration merging, allowing multiple declarations with the same name to be merged into a single definition. Types do not support this.

Scope:


Interfaces are open and can be extended after their initial declaration. Types are closed and cannot be changed once defined.


Usage:


Interfaces are primarily used to define the structure of objects and classes. Types are more versatile and can be used to define aliases for any kind of type, including primitives, unions, and intersections.


Complexity:


Types can express more complex type structures, such as union types, mapped types, and conditional types, which are not possible with interfaces.


Error messages:


Interface names will always appear in their original form in error messages, but type aliases may appear in error messages, sometimes in place of the equivalent anonymous type.


Here are examples of how to use types and interfaces:



```typescript

// Interface
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Type alias
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// Union type using type
type Result = string | number;
```
In general, it's recommended to use interfaces when defining the structure of objects and classes, and types for everything else. However, personal preference and project requirements can also influence the choice.
